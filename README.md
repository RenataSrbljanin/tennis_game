This is a program written in java that simulates a Tennis game.
Given 2 players, randomly assign points to one of the players,
then call the score (Thirty-Love, Deuce, Advantage Player 1, etc.) each time.
For example, when the game starts, the score is Love-All. If Player 1 scores after the first round, the second score shown is Fifteen-Love.
If Player 2 scores after the second round, the third score shown is Fifteen-All.
If the game continues this way and both players get 4 points apiece, the score is Deuce.
In other words, a random gameâ€™s output could be an array of 
Love-All, Fifteen-Love, Thirty-Love, Thirty-Fifteen, Thirty-All, Advantage Player 1, Deuce, Advantage Player 2, Win for Player 2.
